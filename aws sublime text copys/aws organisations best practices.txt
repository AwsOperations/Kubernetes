Aws Organisations best practices:

Monitor activity in the master account using Cloudtrail.
Do not assign SCP policies at the start instead use all the custom policies inside OU's account itself.
First deploy everything and then finegrain with SCP's or any other resources from the OU level.
Test controls on single acccount first.
See billing is happening on every single account.
