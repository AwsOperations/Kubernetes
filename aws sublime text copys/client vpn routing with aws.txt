client vpn routing with aws

vpc range is = 192.168.0.0/16  ----------->created by eksctl 

client vpn endpoint range is = 10.0.0.0/20

jenkins should be installed in private ap-south-1a subnet

security groups of jenkins should allow port 22 with 192.168.0.0/16 as cidr
because when vpn is connected an ip will be assigned by vpn with the same series of 192.168.0.0/16 to communicate with the nodegroup and private subnets
